# Introduction

Real time monitoring of the activities of your agents and queues are essential to ensure customer success, that operations are running efficiently and to avoid agent burnout.

Genesys Cloud CX offers native capability for easy real time monitoring dashboards, called Performance Dashboards. These Performance Dashboards will meet the needs for many contact centers.

For those contact centers who need a little more, Genesys Cloud CX is also a platform, offering powerful REST APIs. Customers with time and resources to program APIs can take that route if they choose. For customers who prefer a prebuilt solution with capabilities to further extend their Genesys Cloud CX implementation, Genesys offers the AppFoundry marketplace.

Genesys AppFoundry marketplace partners like PureInsights offer pre built applications to evolve your Genesys Cloud CX reporting and analytics with both real time and historic data.
